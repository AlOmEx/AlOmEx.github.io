              As for myself, I’m often get noticed as a hybrid of Indian and Vietnamese. That is False. I’m only Vietnamese (as seen in the picture with distinguishable Asian traits and name).
              *Disclaimer : I’m not an example to show how Indians is like and by no means to offend them.
              I’m going to be 19 for the upcoming September ( my birthday is 21/09), which means I’m around 18 and a half ( as for my mother who always address my age by my year rather than the accurate date). Bilingualism is a skill that I’ve acquired throughout the years of studying. Naturally, I’m fluent at Vietnamese, though it cannot be said the same towards Literature, on the other hand, English is acceptable on the high ranks. However, to hone my language skill to be what it is today, cost a considerable amount of time, embarrassments, and perseverance. Veganism is exceptionally on of my proudest traits. With personal beliefs, vegan is the best option for your diet, not only it contains all crucial nutrients for your health, but also does not add in your bills with lives of animals. Whereas for hobby, sports and gaming are evidently my main theme, even more truthfully speaking, going out with group of friends has to be amongst the best out of all. Though disappointments seem to have been inevitable at times, in the end, friends do indubitably make one’s day better. Moreover, it just so happens that I, including my parents owns a pair of blue and yellow colored Australian parakeets. Their gender still remains unknown to this day, be that as it may, we don't discriminate. The duo can be seen upholding what we informally address as 'chaotic energy', nevertheless the two parrots are still absolutely lovely and adorable.

                          <h2 style="font-size:20px">What is your Interest in IT?</h2
                          <p>To start off with, my interest in I.T had begun to sparked once I had received the introduction to I.T, mainly coding, through colleagues and supervisors; momentarily developing an understanding of what technology are and what they are used for in certain areas. This further served as a foundation for my ever-growing attentiveness, the desire to know more apropos of this topic. With regards to the aforementioned subject, things that have come across my way and intrigued me included; the evolution of technology as time simply passes by, how mankind seem to have a grip on their creation as seen by their hunger to potentialize it, countless open opportunities for fruitful investment in knowledge with unrestrained exploration in creativity and last but not least; uncomplicated matters concerning future occupation with handsome salary.</p>
                          <h3>When did your interest in IT start?</h3>
                          <p>During my junior year of high school, I.T was brought to my attention but solely stayed as that; a simple notice in which halfhearted attempts in discovering more existed back then. It wasn’t until the senior graduation ended and moving onwards into university’s life that I had gained more knowledge regarding this particular subject. As time goes on, it was to be expected that curiosity would undeniably get the best of me and by then, the idea of friends along with the concept of I.T had already made itself familiar in my psyche.</p>
                          <h4 style="font-size:20px">Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest?</h4>
                          <p>Inspiration; a feeling of enthusiasm that gives you creative ideas, in which it was brought upon by something or someone. With that being said, the person whom had given me said inspiration was none other than a YouTuber by the name of “Michael Reeves”. This bizarrely intelligent man whom also possesses quite a chaotic energy, would occasionally invent machinery from the comments he had received and bring them to life. Often times than not in his video, screen time displaying; demonstrations of hard work involving the making of each of his creation, the process and progress of each inventions, blood, sweat and tears of this brilliant man had poured on all of  his projects; were showcased and endearingly appreciated by his fans.</p>
                          <h5 style="font-size:20px">Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h5>
                          <p>Vaguely mentioning, there were undoubtedly a lot of reasons as to why the choice of academy had landed on RMIT. However, 2 main causes will be specifically called out within the following the sentences. The first one being popularity; in which case attention surrounding the university’s whereabouts was widely known, more so that even my friends had envisioned this as a dream school to enter. Moreover, it was also broadly acknowledged for its many possibilities in provision of occupation’s chances or internships for the students to experience or plausibly work at one of the major companies. Secondly; the facility had always had a reputation of being as one of the most generous and supportive college with reasonable pricing, additionally very quick to adapt and update its system to be relevant with the current age of technology and to further accommodate with automation’s ever evolving nature; making it uncomplicated for scholar to gain access to. Not to mention, all the helpful system being available such as “RMIT Connect” which is open to supply guidance to anyone who may need it. With such factors taken into account; it was to be given that learners would be eager to enroll here.</p>
                          <h6 style="font-size:20px">What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h6>
                          <p>Expectations are often times, best advised to be set as realistic or with reachable and reasonable standards; especially in career paths. In my circumstances, the learning skills in which has been anticipated to be achieved involves; the ability to code and decode, the capability in mastering the arts of debugging said codes, being taught to understand the concept of teamwork which will be proven useful in future situations and serves fruitful in management departments.</p>

                          <p>Upon being done with all the three tests being linked above, it can be definitively said that several parts of the results did caught me off guard whilst the rest were unsurprisingly anticipated and awfully accurate. To briefly discuss the ones that attracted my attention, the core factor in being categorized as an extroverted type of person was indeed blissfully shocking at first; however, as more constructed thoughts came to mind, it didn’t sound too impossible. Admittedly; I did once view myself as an introvert, particularly due to my disapproval in social interactions, nonetheless as previously mentioned; my outlook on it momentarily changed as it was only my conservative nature being misunderstood as introverted. In addition to this, personally being grouped as “feeling oriented” wasn’t much of a surprise, although it cannot be spoken the same for others as I tend to be perceived as a logistic type rather than the “emotional” type. Moreover; tendency to not lead heavily to one side than the other can be seen in the first test’s conclusion above, this include my neutrality between intuitive/observant and judging/prospecting. This would explain why my identity is mainly turbulent; as it is unstable at times.</p>

Although the conclusion did not personally strike any meaning as much; it was still exceptionally intriguing to read a solid description concerning my mental state.</p>
                          <h5 style="font-size:20px">How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h5>
                          <p>Taking all of the finalized results above into account; it could be modestly said that my behavior would most likely be beneficial for the team. Often times than not, thrift for social intelligence, order and harmony are essential for me; a clearly define sense of responsibility together with a sense of purpose, is what usually being carried within myself as I prefer to be as hard working, patience as well as efficient as possible. On account of preference in teamwork and it being a concept in which there is no trouble occurring when put to practice, not to mention lending a helping hand when and where it’s needed is not a task difficult to do. Even so, it must be mentioned here that curtsy of unconstructive criticism and rejection tend to not be taken so lightly along with unrecognized or unvalued hard work tend to leave a sense of unfulfilled, tiredness, eventually leading to stress and anxiety to pile up.</p>
                          <h6 style="font-size:20px">How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h6>
                          <p>While as for the notion of forming a concise team, It can be mentioned here that members with a similar traits with mine will surely work well, such as people who knows their responsibilities and is able to get done what needs to be done, those who are respective of one another’s authority and regulations as well as in workplaces with structure, safety and guidelines, and especially those who make an effort to express their appreciation from time to time. People who usually slack off, are irresponsible or reckless do not mix well with my element, as proper balance and tranquility is more than welcomed.</p>
