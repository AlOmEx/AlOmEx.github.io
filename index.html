              As for myself, I’m often get noticed as a hybrid of Indian and Vietnamese. That is False. I’m only Vietnamese (as seen in the picture with distinguishable Asian traits and name).
              *Disclaimer : I’m not an example to show how Indians is like and by no means to offend them.
              I’m going to be 19 for the upcoming September ( my birthday is 21/09), which means I’m around 18 and a half ( as for my mother who always address my age by my year rather than the accurate date). Bilingualism is a skill that I’ve acquired throughout the years of studying. Naturally, I’m fluent at Vietnamese, though it cannot be said the same towards Literature, on the other hand, English is acceptable on the high ranks. However, to hone my language skill to be what it is today, cost a considerable amount of time, embarrassments, and perseverance. Veganism is exceptionally on of my proudest traits. With personal beliefs, vegan is the best option for your diet, not only it contains all crucial nutrients for your health, but also does not add in your bills with lives of animals. Whereas for hobby, sports and gaming are evidently my main theme, even more truthfully speaking, going out with group of friends has to be amongst the best out of all. Though disappointments seem to have been inevitable at times, in the end, friends do indubitably make one’s day better. Moreover, it just so happens that I, including my parents owns a pair of blue and yellow colored Australian parakeets. Their gender still remains unknown to this day, be that as it may, we don't discriminate. The duo can be seen upholding what we informally address as 'chaotic energy', nevertheless the two parrots are still absolutely lovely and adorable.

                          <h2 style="font-size:20px">What is your Interest in IT?</h2
                          <p>To start off with, my interest in I.T had begun to sparked once I had received the introduction to I.T, mainly coding, through colleagues and supervisors; momentarily developing an understanding of what technology are and what they are used for in certain areas. This further served as a foundation for my ever-growing attentiveness, the desire to know more apropos of this topic. With regards to the aforementioned subject, things that have come across my way and intrigued me included; the evolution of technology as time simply passes by, how mankind seem to have a grip on their creation as seen by their hunger to potentialize it, countless open opportunities for fruitful investment in knowledge with unrestrained exploration in creativity and last but not least; uncomplicated matters concerning future occupation with handsome salary.</p>
                          <h3>When did your interest in IT start?</h3>
                          <p>During my junior year of high school, I.T was brought to my attention but solely stayed as that; a simple notice in which halfhearted attempts in discovering more existed back then. It wasn’t until the senior graduation ended and moving onwards into university’s life that I had gained more knowledge regarding this particular subject. As time goes on, it was to be expected that curiosity would undeniably get the best of me and by then, the idea of friends along with the concept of I.T had already made itself familiar in my psyche.</p>
                          <h4 style="font-size:20px">Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest?</h4>
                          <p>Inspiration; a feeling of enthusiasm that gives you creative ideas, in which it was brought upon by something or someone. With that being said, the person whom had given me said inspiration was none other than a YouTuber by the name of “Michael Reeves”. This bizarrely intelligent man whom also possesses quite a chaotic energy, would occasionally invent machinery from the comments he had received and bring them to life. Often times than not in his video, screen time displaying; demonstrations of hard work involving the making of each of his creation, the process and progress of each inventions, blood, sweat and tears of this brilliant man had poured on all of  his projects; were showcased and endearingly appreciated by his fans.</p>
                          <h5 style="font-size:20px">Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h5>
                          <p>Vaguely mentioning, there were undoubtedly a lot of reasons as to why the choice of academy had landed on RMIT. However, 2 main causes will be specifically called out within the following the sentences. The first one being popularity; in which case attention surrounding the university’s whereabouts was widely known, more so that even my friends had envisioned this as a dream school to enter. Moreover, it was also broadly acknowledged for its many possibilities in provision of occupation’s chances or internships for the students to experience or plausibly work at one of the major companies. Secondly; the facility had always had a reputation of being as one of the most generous and supportive college with reasonable pricing, additionally very quick to adapt and update its system to be relevant with the current age of technology and to further accommodate with automation’s ever evolving nature; making it uncomplicated for scholar to gain access to. Not to mention, all the helpful system being available such as “RMIT Connect” which is open to supply guidance to anyone who may need it. With such factors taken into account; it was to be given that learners would be eager to enroll here.</p>
                          <h6 style="font-size:20px">What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h6>
                          <p>Expectations are often times, best advised to be set as realistic or with reachable and reasonable standards; especially in career paths. In my circumstances, the learning skills in which has been anticipated to be achieved involves; the ability to code and decode, the capability in mastering the arts of debugging said codes, being taught to understand the concept of teamwork which will be proven useful in future situations and serves fruitful in management departments.</p>

                          <p>Upon being done with all the three tests being linked above, it can be definitively said that several parts of the results did caught me off guard whilst the rest were unsurprisingly anticipated and awfully accurate. To briefly discuss the ones that attracted my attention, the core factor in being categorized as an extroverted type of person was indeed blissfully shocking at first; however, as more constructed thoughts came to mind, it didn’t sound too impossible. Admittedly; I did once view myself as an introvert, particularly due to my disapproval in social interactions, nonetheless as previously mentioned; my outlook on it momentarily changed as it was only my conservative nature being misunderstood as introverted. In addition to this, personally being grouped as “feeling oriented” wasn’t much of a surprise, although it cannot be spoken the same for others as I tend to be perceived as a logistic type rather than the “emotional” type. Moreover; tendency to not lead heavily to one side than the other can be seen in the first test’s conclusion above, this include my neutrality between intuitive/observant and judging/prospecting. This would explain why my identity is mainly turbulent; as it is unstable at times.</p>

On account of preference in teamwork and it being a concept in which there is no trouble occurring when put to practice, not to mention lending a helping hand when and where it’s needed is not a task difficult to do. Even so, it must be mentioned here that curtsy of unconstructive criticism and rejection tend to not be taken so lightly along with unrecognized or unvalued hard work tend to leave a sense of unfulfilled, tiredness, eventually leading to stress and anxiety to pile up.</p>
                          <h6 style="font-size:20px">How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h6>
                          <p>While as for the notion of forming a concise team, It can be mentioned here that members with a similar traits with mine will surely work well, such as people who knows their responsibilities and is able to get done what needs to be done, those who are respective of one another’s authority and regulations as well as in workplaces with structure, safety and guidelines, and especially those who make an effort to express their appreciation from time to time. People who usually slack off, are irresponsible or reckless do not mix well with my element, as proper balance and tranquility is more than welcomed.</p>

              <h1 style="font-size:40px">PROJECT IDEA</h1>
              <h2 style="font-size:20px">Overview</h2>
              <p>As a gamer who endearingly held an unconditional love towards various games as well as being amazed by some of the well-crafted arts, along with outstanding storylines with innumerable characters, pets, etc. … To lead to the project of choice shall be: a game. A game with the generic mechanic of the well-loved franchise: Final Fantasy that will involve staggering plots, breathtaking atmosphere, well-designed characters and others unrevealed factors which shall be later included to compete with multitude of other games. With personal beliefs, team effort shall put a dream to a reality and reaches the highest possible pedestal and known to the world. </p>
              <h3 style="font-size:20px">Motivation</h3>

              <img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DRVjzFhW0AAydlj.png">
              <p>With the famous line of Mary McLeod Bethune: “Without faith nothing is possible, with faith nothing is impossible” or perhaps from Helen Keller: “Nothing can be done without hope and confidence”. Motivation; the process that initiates, guides, and maintains goal-oriented behaviors; quite frankly it is what causes people to do the things that they have done, to behave and act the way that they are. At times, it can be a feeling that pushes you to a certain direction; whether that’d be good or bad, it should be said here that motivation is not something easily to grasp as well. With that being said, what motivated me to consider this as a project idea was based off of my undying love for video game and exceptionally speaking; one of my favorite gaming franchises being “Final Fantasy”. It can also be stated here that, inspiration taken from aforementioned game series was undeniable as it was something I have enjoying playing. Not to mention, my own personal beliefs that this will not only be a fun project but one that will assist players in providing more interactive services; considering our current crisis where social distancing is key to being prone from the infection.</p>
              <h4 style="font-size:20px">Description</h4>
              <p>“Have you ever wondered where those who follow the path weaved by the 7 deadly sins go to? When the grandfather clock chimed its last tick tock; for neither heaven nor hell shall bestow upon them their punishments just yet, as they will be given a second chance to redeem themselves. Will they survive and unravel the hidden truth? Or will they succumb to the enchanting embrace of their own misdeeds?” — a brief synopsis. Heliolite is a science fantasy type of video game coupled with a choose your own adventure mechanic and genre; with countless possibilities and paths awaiting to be discovered and explored. It has a story about a main character being transported into a whole new world in which they will first answer riddles given to them regarding their past lives; only after that will a specific mark representing the 7 kingdoms (which themes are inspired by the sins itself: Envy, Gluttony, Greed, Lust, Pride, Sloth, and Wrath) shall appear on the character’s skin. Once they have arrived at their respective nation, one can only rely on their knowledge gained during their previous life and thus, on the land they have been sorted in; thou shall set out on a journey in hopes to obtain newly unfold secrets regarding this magical yet dangerous realm. Along their adventure, they will encounter numberless otherworldly creatures along with native inhabitants and races; all of which with different range of friendliness including; hostile, idling, and neutral mobs. Likewise, with any other fictional slice of life game and a daily scheduled unlocked kingdom accessible for all, travelers will be capable of going on exploration, quests, dungeons with bosses and raids in order to gain loot for any desirable item or upgrade. But of course, with every new purchase comes a cost; and with that, players will have to look out for their “resistance bar” while touring other domains as they are only “immune” to their residential area, so beware and be vary of your avatar’s sanity. With that being said, the game will have numerous available functions for the player such as; customizable character/avatar creation, helpful tutorials, fully fleshed out in game lore, settings with simple to understand guidance, multiplayer compacted and is purchasable for free on mobile, PC and VR. Not only that, but perhaps one of the game’s most iconic and memorable features are; it’s AI’s and gamer’s ability to communicate and be interactive with all of the players, by all means; hand written speech bubbles or voice chat are heavily supported as to encourage social communication. Plus, it’s all happening in a game too, so you’ll be virus-free! In this case, the AIs are more than just your ordinary NPCs as these robots will be programmed to be able to response to questions, especially those regarding about in need assistance for the game. Moreover, they can even link you with any free-to-interact people on server as well; as there will be a comfortable hub specifically and solely designed for casual communication as well as serving as a tranquil place to breathe and rest, take a break whilst you let your mind escape the “Gacha rage”.</p>
              <h5 style="font-size:20px">Tools and Technology</h5>
              <p>For this to all be created and operated on; tools and technologies are absolutely essential in making this come to life; as mentioned programs such as RPG maker 2; with features including 3D graphics, events customization (driving cut scenes, boos battles and other effects) together with music installation. In addition to this, Unity 3D is by far one of the most ubiquitous tools being used today for VR development, whilst as it’s heart, it’s still a game engine. With a huge community around this tool, plenty of resources and documentation, a market of 3D assets along with a direct VR mode to preview your work in an HMD; it’s no wonder why it has remained on top as one of the best programs. Speaking of Unity 3D, Unreal Engine is one of its main competitors with graphics that are debatably more advanced and realistic coupled with a similar learning curve to Unity 3D. It provides more life-like and smoother motions along with great performance as well.</p>
              <h6 style="font-size:20px">Skill required</h6>
              <p>Not only are the previously mentioned tools and technologies being essential; but one must also talented in these required skills as well. Those may include; communication and critical thinking skills coupled with a good team combination, Skillful storytelling and presentation talent along with basic drawings or advanced visual designing skill, and basic scripting and programming knowledge with user interface. Furthermore, individuals with moderate fluency in 2D and 3D animation piled with awareness of game platforms along with a great understanding of gameplay theory are also a contributing factor. Needless to say, there will undoubtedly be obstacles and challenges along the way in trying to find these aforesaid skills; nevertheless, it is not impossible, just solely something that requires a lot of time, energy, dedication and a stable financial support.</p>
              <h7 style="font-size:20px">Outcome</h7>
              <p>We live life in a constant state of present; never fully knowing what will happen in the future and can only let bygones such as the past stays as it is, one can always choose to dwell or instead learn from their previously made mistakes as well; an admirable trait to acquire. With all the odds being in our favor and if this project were to be proven and deemed as successful, then the outcome would be able to produce a game in which can rivals the top competitive ones. Albeit, that is an astounding goal to reach, personally content would be received if it were to ever helped someone in giving them mental support when they needed it the most. It could be why the interactive function was such a core feature, it was the main goal after all; to aid and guide those who are lost and in need to emotional support, or plainly saying, a shoulder to lean to.</p>
